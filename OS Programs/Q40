In Linux, file access permissions are set using three types of users: owner, group, and others. Each user can be assigned one or more of the following permissions for a file:

Read (r): Allows the user to view the contents of the file.
Write (w): Allows the user to modify the contents of the file.
Execute (x): Allows the user to execute the file if it is a script or program.
These permissions can be set separately for each of the three types of users (owner, group, and others) and are represented as a sequence of characters in the file's permission string.

Here's an illustration of the different file access permissions and user types in Linux:

Owner: The user who owns the file. This user can be changed using the chown command. By default, the user who creates the file becomes its owner.

Group: A group of users who share access to the file. Each file is associated with a primary group, and additional groups can be assigned using the chgrp command.

Others: All users who are not the owner or part of the group.

The permission string for a file in Linux typically appears as follows:


-rwxrwxrwx



Each character in the permission string represents a specific permission or attribute:

The first character indicates the file type (- for a regular file, d for a directory, l for a symbolic link, etc.).
The next three characters represent the owner's permissions.
The following three characters represent the group's permissions.
The last three characters represent the permissions for others.
For example:

-rw-r--r-- indicates a regular file with read and write permissions for the owner, and read-only permissions for the group and others.
drwxr-xr-x indicates a directory with read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, and read and execute permissions for the group and others.
To modify file permissions in Linux, you can use the chmod command. To change the ownership of a file or directory, you can use the chown command, and to change the group ownership, you can use the chgrp command.
